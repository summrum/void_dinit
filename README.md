# void_dinit
This repository contains files I used to get Dinit (https://github.com/davmac314/dinit) working as system init on Void Linux (https://voidlinux.org/, https://github.com/void-linux). These have been put together from the Void Runit scripts (https://github.com/void-linux/void-runit), Artix Linux Dinit scripts (https://gitea.artixlinux.org/artixlinux/packages-dinit) and the example services provided with Dinit (https://github.com/davmac314/dinit/tree/master/doc/linux/services). Effectively, all I have done is combine the scripts available from the these sources with just a few very small modifications - all the real work has been carried out by the developers on the aforementioned projects and all credit for this working at all goes to them.

I currently have a (seemingly fully) working KDE Plasma desktop, using Pipewire as the audio system with bluetooth and wireless network connectivity (NetworkManager) on a Void musl system. Runit has been completely uninstalled from this test system using ```ignorepkg=runit``` and ```ignorepkg=runit-void``` in a ```.conf``` file in ```/etc/xbps.d/```. I have not yet attempted to get filesystem encryption or logical volume management working. This was purely for fun and to teach myself more about initialising a Linux system; I do not recommend using anything from this repository on anything other than a test system.

```/etc/*``` are files that need to be placed in to ```/etc/```. I have attempted to maintain some compatibility with the ```/etc/rc.*``` files supplied with Void, and I think that the existing files provided by Void _should_ work without issue (if, for example, Runit is not uninstalled from the system these ```/etc/rc.*``` files will still exist).

```/srcpkgs/dinit/template``` is the template file I used for compiling Dinit using ```xbps-src```. This has built without issue for me on glibc and musl x86_x64 systems; I have not tried for other architectures. After installing Dinit, the system shutdown executables will be replaced so this is probably best carried out from a ```chroot```. Instructions for setting Dinit as the system init on Linux are provided at the Dinit repository (https://github.com/davmac314/dinit/blob/master/doc/linux/DINIT-AS-INIT.md).
